# react-native-platform-button

A fork of React Native's built-in button to make it more customizable. In particular, I needed to be able to change `fontSize` on iOS because the default size `18` is wrong for a button in a navigation bar.

- Same as https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/button.html
- But with `fontSize` prop
- Perhaps more options in the future

```
yarn add react-native-platform-button
```
